<h2>This repo contains the task, given to the second year students of CMC faculty of MSU</h2>
<p>The task was to create a simplified programming language interpreter using C++ language</p>
<p>I chose Python as a base language. My interpreter can understand loops, conditions and any expressions.</p>
<p>However, it works only with variables, no lists, tuples, etc. are interpretable.</p>
<p><i>P.S. File with the task is in this repo too</i></p>
